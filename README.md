## Project List

### 1. Blocks
Implements logic to find the optimal block to live in, given distances to amenities (gym, school, store). Demonstrates struct usage and state updates.

### 2. ClassInheritance
Explores C++ class inheritance, virtual functions, and polymorphism with a pet/dog example.

### 3. DataStructures
Implements and tests classic data structures: HashTable, Stack, Queue, and LinkedList. Includes collision handling and basic operations.

### 4. Exception
Demonstrates exception handling in C++ using a custom Stack class and error scenarios.

### 5. Fibonacci
Shows recursive and dynamic programming approaches to compute Fibonacci numbers.

### 6. Graphs
Implements a Graph class with methods for adding edges, printing, and performing depth-first and breadth-first search.

### 7. LinkedListExercise
Exercises advanced linked list operations, including custom node structures and pointer manipulation.

### 8. MoveAllZeros
Provides algorithms to move all zeros in an array to the beginning or end, demonstrating array manipulation.

### 9. Operators
Demonstrates operator overloading in C++ with custom Stack and enum types.

### 10. Sorting
Implements and tests sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and includes a binary search function.

### 11. Strings
Solves string problems such as word segmentation and palindrome listing using sets and recursion.

### 12. Sum2Values
Implements algorithms to find pairs of values that sum to a target and to find subarrays with the largest sum.

### 13. Trees
Implements and tests various tree data structures: Binary Tree, AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, and Heap, with traversal and balancing logic.
